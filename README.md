## DCGAN-Basement
#Generation Maps of Basement by DCGAN

#Hardware requirements: NVIDIA GPU ;Program language: Python 3.11 (Pytorch 2.1);Software required: PyCharm, Anaconda

1 the codes are used to generate basement map according to the real-world basins.

2 the real maps are included in the data file; the model file DCGAN.py is included in the model file.

3 use trainMod.py to train the DCGAN to reach a set of parameters of Generator and Discriminator which are included in the models file.

4 use testMod.py to generate new maps of basement depth, the output of generated maps are also included in the data file.

5 the related functions are included in the utils file.
